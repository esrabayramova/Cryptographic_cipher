# Cryptographic_cipher

This python code is the composite of 3 ciphers - Caesar cipher, transposition cipher and Vigenere cipher.

Vigenere cipher - the last step in the encryption process encrypts the text (the letters) to the emojis.

The program is intended for the encryption of the alphabetical text and any characters other than letters will not be encrypted. The key also consists of the letters and any other characers in the key will be omitted, so make sure there is at least 1 letter in the key.
